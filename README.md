## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) is a widely adopted versioning convention used in software development to communicate meaningful information about changes in a software package. It consists of three main components: major version, minor version, and patch version, in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **Major Version (MAJOR):**
  - Incremented for incompatible API changes.
  - Indicates significant enhancements or changes that might break existing functionality.

- **Minor Version (MINOR):**
  - Incremented for new features or enhancements that are backward-compatible.
  - Indicates additions or improvements without breaking existing features.

- **Patch Version (PATCH):**
  - Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.
  - Indicates minor changes or bug fixes that do not affect the public API.
